# ConCode

ConCode ('Coding for Conservators' and other heritage professionals) is a meeting space for discussing, showcasing and asking questions about data science & coding, and how it can be applied in the museum world. Coding can seem intimidating at first so a space to discuss the challenges has been created to discuss and develop tools in an informal environment. It’ll be assumed that we’re all new to coding and this will be a ‘safe-space’ where we can ask any questions, no matter how small or large and work together to answer them. Some background talks are available here from the Icon ‘Together at Home’ webinar series below. This space is not limited to Conservators and anybody interested in using data science in the cultural heritage.  

## Data Science 

Data science is becoming a larger part of our world and the tools are more available than ever. 

A summary of the data science workflow is presented from Hadley Wickam's website (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
